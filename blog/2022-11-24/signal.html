# What the heck is this about

I'd like to request that we consider switching out current messaging chat group from WhatsApp to <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal Messenger</a><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.  I have become increasingly creeped-out by the changes that Meta/Facebook have made the the WhatsApp Terms of Service which allow for more and more of our WhatApp activities to be shared with other Meta/Facebook business and third parties.  I'm proposing Signal Messenger as an alternative which provides a very similar service but also a business structure and philosophy which attempt to preserve the privacy of its users.


# Why now?

Meta/Facebook have owned WhatsApp since 2014 but until ~2021 they have largely given it the independence that was promised during the acquisition.  WhatApp has operated separately from the social media businesses Meta owns such as Facebook and Instagram and it has been a great communication tool.  However, in 2021 and 2022 WhatsApp made significant changes to its Terms of Service, which I am guessing we all blindly clicked through without reading (myself included), and these changes massively expanded the amount of data which WhatsApp shares with other Meta services such as Facebook and Instagram.  It's not particularly surprising that a company who makes money by targeted advertising would want to use all data at their disposal to build better advertising profiles of their users to recoup the $14 billion dollars they spend on WhatApp, but I think it is noteworthy.


# What is actually changing?

I'm well aware that I already am perceived as being the guy wearing a tin foil hat but in this case I feel Meta/Facebook have stepped into a territory we all should be wary of, not just the privacy fanatics.  I want to be very clear on a specific point: the actual content of our WhatsApp chats are still end-to-end encrypted<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, meaning that if you send me a message it will be encrypted during the time it is stored on WhatsApp's servers and the actual content of the message cannot my read until it is decrypted on my phone.  What is being shared is referred to as "meta-data" or basically everything except the actual message itself.  Examples of meta-data include who you communicate with, uploading your phone's address book to Meta/Facebook, how much you communicate with your contacts, the times and duration you use the app, etc.

The drier, more expansive list from  WhatsApp's actual revised policy also spells out the kind of information it gathers from users' devices: hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information (including phone number, mobile operator or ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information, and identifiers (including identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the same device or account).  As for location, "Even if you do not use our location-related features, we use IP addresses and other information like phone number area codes to estimate your general location (e.g., city and country)..."  On its own, each piece of information seems minor but aggregated, and compared against the other hundreds of millions of WhatApp, Instagram, and Facebook users, an pretty precise profile of your life can be built and sold.

Regarding meta-data, I like the analogy of living in a glass house.  WhatsApp has provided you with the use of a glass house to conduct your work, with the promise that they are unable to listen to the conversations that you have in the glass house.  While true, meta-data collection in this analogy means that there are people sitting outside the house watching everything that you do - what you eat, where you shop, they browse through your trash, look at the return addresses of the parcels you receive, who visits you, etc.  But as promised they are unable to hear what was said.


# Why Signal

I am proposing Signal Messenger as an alternative because it strives to offer equivalent communication features without compromising user privacy as a means to do so.  Signal is backed by a non-profit

Answer: One of the most important things this update is doing is establishing the rules governing the usage of meta-data, which has implications for any Facebook service including WhatsApp.


*** In response, people who care about the Signal Protocol (and privacy in general) have emphasized the solution to this problem: using an open-source app like Signal. This way, anyone can audit and improve the code. But more importantly, Signal neither has the software capabilities nor the institutional predisposition to collect your meta-data. Both of those problems WhatsApp has had for a long time.


--------


While WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted, its privacy policy offers an insight into the scale and wealth of metadata that's amassed in the name of improving and supporting the service. Even worse, all of this data is linked to a user's identity.

Apple's response to this unchecked metadata collection is privacy labels, now live for first- and third-party apps distributed via the App Store, that aim to help users better understand an app's privacy practices and "learn about some of the data types an app may collect, and whether that data is linked to them or used to track them."

The rollout forced WhatsApp to issue a statement last month. "We must collect some information to provide a reliable global communications service," it said, adding "we minimize the categories of data that we collect" and "we take measures to restrict access to that information."

In stark contrast, Signal collects no metadata, whereas Apple's iMessage makes use of only email address (or phone number), search history, and a device ID to attribute a user uniquely.

There's no denying that privacy policies and terms of service agreements are often long, boring, and mired in obtuse legalese as if deliberately designed with an intention to confuse users. But updates like this are the reason it's essential to read them instead of blindly consenting without really knowing what you are signing up for. After all, it is your data.
