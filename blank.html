Basic Metadata
To turn your web pages into graph objects, you need to add basic metadata to your page. We've based the initial version of the protocol on RDFa which means that you'll place additional <meta> tags in the <head> of your web page. The four required properties for every page are:

og:title - The title of your object as it should appear within the graph, e.g., "The Rock".
og:type - The type of your object, e.g., "video.movie". Depending on the type you specify, other properties may also be required.
og:image - An image URL which should represent your object within the graph.
og:url - The canonical URL of your object that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph, e.g., "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/".
As an example, the following is the Open Graph protocol markup for The Rock on IMDB:

<html prefix="og: https://ogp.me/ns#">
<head>
<title>The Rock (1996)</title>
<meta property="og:title" content="The Rock" />
<meta property="og:type" content="video.movie" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/rock.jpg" />
...
</head>
...
</html>
Optional Metadata
The following properties are optional for any object and are generally recommended:

og:audio - A URL to an audio file to accompany this object.
og:description - A one to two sentence description of your object.
og:determiner - The word that appears before this object's title in a sentence. An enum of (a, an, the, "", auto). If auto is chosen, the consumer of your data should chose between "a" or "an". Default is "" (blank).
og:locale - The locale these tags are marked up in. Of the format language_TERRITORY. Default is en_US.
og:locale:alternate - An array of other locales this page is available in.
og:site_name - If your object is part of a larger web site, the name which should be displayed for the overall site. e.g., "IMDb".
og:video - A URL to a video file that complements this object.
For example (line-break solely for display purposes):

<meta property="og:audio" content="https://example.com/bond/theme.mp3" />
<meta property="og:description" 
  content="Sean Connery found fame and fortune as the
           suave, sophisticated British agent, James Bond." />
<meta property="og:determiner" content="the" />
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_GB" />
<meta property="og:locale:alternate" content="fr_FR" />
<meta property="og:locale:alternate" content="es_ES" />
<meta property="og:site_name" content="IMDb" />
<meta property="og:video" content="https://example.com/bond/trailer.swf" />


Line by line explanation

<!DOCTYPE html>
For the old-schoolers among you, you don’t need any of the other doc types you’ve learned by heart. This is the one and only. Even though today there are no other real options, it has to be present for compatibility reasons.

<html lang="en" class="no-js">
The lang attribute is one of the most important attributes in HTML, because it’s powerful and responsible for many things. You can read more about it in On Use of the Lang Attribute and The lang attribute: browsers telling lies, telling sweet little lies. Applied to the html element, it defines the natural language of the page. It contains a single “language tag” in the format defined in Tags for Identifying Languages (BCP47), for example en for English, de for German or ru for Russian.

I use the no-js class in case I want to apply styling to specific components in browsers that don’t support JavaScript. This class will be removed in browsers that support and execute modern JavaScript.

<meta charset="UTF-8">
This attribute declares the document’s character encoding. Leaving it off might cause specific characters to display incorrectly in some browsers.

Here’s how Safari displays my name with and without the charset meta tag.

It must come before the <title> element to avoid faulty characters in the page title.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
The viewport meta tag allows us to change the width of the viewport, which is necessary for responsive web design. width=device-width sets the viewport width to the width of the screen. initial-scale controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded.

I’m not sure if setting initial-scale=1 is still necessary. I believe I read somewhere that it was only needed for Safari on < iOS 9, but I can’t find the article anymore.

The viewport meta tag should come as early as possible in the document to ensure proper document rendering.

We dont need the shrink-to-fit=no option anymore since iOS 9.3.

Time to remove the shrink-to-fit=no band aid?

<title>Unique page title - My Site</title>
The unique title of the page. It’s displayed in many places, for example, on the browser tab, in search engine results, when you save a page as a bookmark, etc.

I’m cutting the mustard at JS module support. If a browser supports JavaScript modules, it means that it’s a browser that supports modern JavaScript, such as modules, ES 6 syntax, fetch, etc. I ship most JS only to these browsers and I use the js class in CSS, if the styling of a component is different, when JS is active.

<meta name="description" content="Page description">
The unique description of the page, for example, displayed on search result pages. It can be any length, but search engines truncate snippets to ~155–160 characters.

<meta property="og:title" content="Unique page title - My Site">
The unique title of the page. Used by URL scrapers on social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook.

<meta property="og:description" content="Page description">
The unique description of the page. Used by URL scrapers on social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook.

<meta property="og:image" content="image.jpg">
The image displayed when you share the link to a page on social media, chat applications, or other sites that scrape URLs.

Ideally, it should be a square image with the important content placed in the middle of the square in a rectangle with a 2:1 ratio. This will make sure that the image will look good in cards with rectangle and square shaped images.

Rules for Twitter: Images for this Card support an aspect ratio of 2:1 with minimum dimensions of 300x157 or maximum of 4096x4096 pixels. Images must be less than 5MB in size. JPG, PNG, WEBP and GIF formats are supported.

<meta property="og:image:alt" content="Image description">
A description of the image. Don’t use this meta tag if the image is purely decorative and doesn’t provide any meaningful information. Screen readers ignore the image, if we don’t provide alt text.

<meta property="og:locale" content="en_GB">
An optional Open Graph property, but recommended. It defines the natural language of the page.

<meta property="og:type" content="website">
The type of content you’re sharing, e.g. website, article, or video.movie. A required property for valid Open Graph pages.

<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.mywebsite.com/page">
The canonical URL of the page. A required property for valid Open Graph pages.

<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
This meta tag defines how cards will look when shared on Twitter. There are two options for websites, summary and summary_large_image.

You can see that I’m using a square image to ensure that the card looks good in both variations. I’ve painted the top and bottom part of the card pink so that you can see that these parts will be cut off in a summary_large_image.

<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
The 180×180px icon Apple devices will use if you add the page to your home screen.

<link rel="manifest" href="/my.webmanifest">
For Android devices we need a .webmanifest file, which provides browsers with the information where the icons needed for the home screen and the splash screen for PWAs are located.

<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.mywebsite.com/page">
Use the canonical link element to prevent SEO issues caused by duplicate content by specifying the original source for pages that are available on multiple URLs.

<link type="application/atom+xml" rel="alternate" href="/feed.xml" title="My Blog - Manuel Matuzovic">
RSS Feed for your site.

<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no">

<meta name="twitter:dnt" content="on">
Disallow Twitter from using your site’s info for personalization purposes.
